# About me

About myself, I can say that I am a positive person, with the desire to constantly evolve. On the one hand, I am characterized by attention to details, the desire to learn new things through work and exercise, and on the other hand, I am an organized person, I like to work in a team due to the acquired communication and collaboration skills.
For some time, I have been attracted to the IT field, so I took an accredited Java programming course and I can't wait to find my place in a company where I can deepen the knowledge I have acquired and obtain new ones, to gain hands-on experience.
